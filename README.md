Polybar Configuration

This directory contains the configuration files for my Polybar setup.

Features:

    Customizable colorscheme
    Shows workspaces, active windows, system tray, and various system information (memory, CPU, network, date)
    Uses internal Polybar modules for simplicity

Instructions:

    Copy this directory to your ~/.config/polybar directory (or your preferred location).
    (Optional) Adjust the configuration files (colors, modules, etc.) to match your preferences. Refer to the Polybar documentation for details on available options: https://github.com/polybar/polybar

Note:

    This is a basic configuration file. You might need to adjust it based on your system and preferences.
